# bamazon
bamazon is an storefront CLI app inspired by Amazon.

bamazon lives at <http://github.com/dezrogers/bamazon-app>.

# DISCLAIMER
If bamazon blows up your computer, loses your job or just deletes all your purchase history, I am NOT liable for anything.

That said, bamazon hasn't disappointed me yet.
